    "# Training PEFT models with new tokens being added to the embedding layers and tokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will learn how to train a LoRA model when adding new tokens to the tokenizer and model.\n",
    "This is a common usecase when doing the following:\n",
    "1. Instruction finetuning with new tokens beind added such as `<|user|>`, `<|assistant|>`, `<|system|>`, `</s>`, `<s>` to properly format the conversations\n",
    "2. Finetuning on a specific language wherein language spoecific tokens are added, e.g., korean tokens being added to vocabulary for finetuning LLM on Korean datasets.\n",
    "3. Instruction finetuning to return outputs in certain format to enable agent behaviour new tokens such as `<|FUNCTIONS|>`, `<|BROWSE|>`, `<|TEXT2IMAGE|>`, `<|ASR|>`, `<|TTS|>`, `<|GENERATECODE|>`, `<|RAG|>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, you add the Embedding modules to the LORA `target_modules`. PEFT will take care of saving the embedding layers with the new added tokens along with the adapter weights that were trained on the specific initialization of the embeddings weights of the added tokens."

The code defines a function called \"calculate_modulo\" which takes two integer arguments, x and y. It checks if the input arguments are integers, raising a TypeError if they are not. It also checks if y is zero, raising a ZeroDivisionError if it is. \\n\\nInside the function, the modulo operation x % y is performed and the result is stored in a variable called \"result\". Finally, the function returns the result.\\n\\nAfter defining the function, the code sets x to 5 and y to 2. It then calls the \"calculate_modulo\" function with x and y as arguments and stores the result in the variable \"x_mod_y\". The code then prints the result using string formatting.\\n\\nIf there are any errors or issues, the code catches them using try-except blocks. If a TypeError occurs, it prints the error message \"Error: The input arguments must be integers.\" If a ZeroDivisionError occurs, it prints the error message \"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\"\\n\\nOne potential error that may arise from running this code is if the input arguments to the \"calculate_modulo\" function are not integers. This will raise a TypeError and the corresponding error message will be printed.\\n\\nAnother potential error is if the value of y is 0. This will raise a ZeroDivisionError and the corresponding error message will be printed.\\n\\nBy including error handling and type checking, the code provides a more robust solution and helps prevent unexpected errors or issues.\\n\\nHowever, there are a few logical steps missing in the code. To increase the difficulty, we can add some additional steps:\\n\\n1. Add a check to ensure that both x and y are positive integers. Raise a ValueError if either of them is negative.\\n2. Instead of directly calculating the modulo, use a loop to repeatedly subtract y from x until x becomes less than y. The number of subtractions performed will be the modulo result. Update the code to reflect this change.\\n3. After calculating the modulo, add a check to see if the result is a prime number.
